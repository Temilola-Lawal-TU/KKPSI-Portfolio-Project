               <p class="caption">We work much better together and that is why brotherhood is one of the pillars. We hve
                    to trust that others will help us in tough times and we will help them. By promoting brotherhood, we
                    encourage others to support and care for another."</p>
               <p class="caption">I feel very very strongly about brotherhood. Brotherhood is very important when it
                    comes to organizations, and having a strong foundation with each other builds a strong foundation
                    with our other pillars."</p>

               <p class="caption">"Service brings people of the organization together while working hand in hand on

               <p class="caption">"It's much more than putting up the podium and picking up yard markers. Much more than
                    tear down. Everything you do is a service to someone, whether it be others or yourself."</p>

               <p class="caption">"Once you take off the training wheels of your bike, your road to becoming a stronger
                    leader has started. Be who you want to see leading and enjoy it."</p>
               <p class="caption">"To be a leader, you must be okay with your team believing they achieved great things
                    on their own. To lead is to want the best for your community even if the best may not be you.
                    Leadership is not a position, but a mindset. Cultivate it here. Live in it now."</p>

                    shows off certain talents one might possess, but it shows off an individuals dedication, reasoning,
                    and much more that defines them more as a person."</p>
